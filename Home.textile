h3. Who are we?

We're a couple of friends working on an idea: "Create the best on-line collaborative mind mapping tool ever created". This has been our idea since the first day we started. We've been working on this project on our free time without any kind of economical support. If you want to contact us, send us an email to team@wisemapping.com. Let us know what do you think about WiseMapping.

h5. Which technology do we use?

We do not use Flash. Instead we use SVG for Firefox and Safari, and VML for IE and Opera.

SVG (Scalable Vectorial Graphics) allows straightforward and efficient vector graphics animation and VML (Vector Markup Language) supports the markup of vector graphic information in the same way that HTML supports the markup of textual information.
