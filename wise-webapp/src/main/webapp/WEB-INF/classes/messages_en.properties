INSTALL_CFG=You need to install the Google Chrome Frame Plugin
INSTALL_CFG_REASON = We used to support IE 7/8 by rendering VML instead of SVG. In a few words, VML was the SVG equivalent in the Microsoft world, and we have invested a lot of energy in VML during several years solving several performance and instability issues among others things. Since Internet Explorer 9 has support for HTML 5.0 (thus SVG support), we decided to deprecate the support of VML. The side effect of this is that all users using Internet Explorer 7/8 will have to install a plugin from Google that enables the display of HTML 5.0 web pages.<br/>You might have to reopen the browser after you have installed the plugin.<br/><br/>We highly recommend using Firefox, Chrome or Internet Explorer 9 where this plugin is not required and the performance is much better.
